# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |

| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

## Data Encryption

The backend encrypts PHI fields such as `Memory.content` using a symmetric key.
Set the key with the `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. The key must be
an URL-safe base64 string generated by `cryptography.Fernet.generate_key()`.
Rotate the key periodically and store it securely outside of source control
(e.g. in your deployment secrets manager).
